MonetaVerdeâ€™s blockchain was rebased and released in April 2019. Recognizing the various challenges and competition between cryptocurrencies we decided to set ourself in a different light with our unique approach to becoming the very first Cryptonote multi-algorithm proof of work (PoW) blockchain. This approach has put us in a position where we can always grow in a co-operative manner within the digital currency world. 

We can confirm transactions by merge mining with over 100 different cryptocurrencies so far. 

We use a unique algorithm to increase block reward with difficulty change and keep miners motivation.
Our ability to merge with so my coins puts us in a rather secure and stable environment.

* First Block: June 17, 2014 
* Money Supply: Infinite
* Block Reward: Ascending with difficulty
* Block Maturity: 60 seconds
* Block Confirmation: Proof of Work
* Current Circulation: approximately 75,000,000 (as of September 2019)
